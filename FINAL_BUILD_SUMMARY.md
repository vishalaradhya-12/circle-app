## 📊 **BUILD HISTORY:**

| Build | Status | IP Address | Issue |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| #1 | ❌ | 192.168.29.43 | Double `/api/api` path |
| #2 | ❌ | 192.168.29.43 | Same issue |
| #3 | ❌ | 10.0.2.2 | Emulator IP (wrong for real device) |
| #4 | ❌ | 10.206.8.29 | Hotspot IP (power issue) |
| **#5** | ✅ | **192.168.29.43** | **FINAL - All fixes!** |

---

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED:**

1. ✅ API URL: Changed from `http://192.168.29.43:3000/api` to `http://192.168.29.43:3000`
2. ✅ Routes: Backend routes already have `/api`, so no double path
3. ✅ IP Address: Using WiFi IP (not hotspot, not emulator)
4. ✅ TypeScript errors: Fixed midnight theme type casting
5. ✅ Database schema: Added new columns for features

---

## 💡 **WHY IT WILL WORK NOW:**

**The Issue Was:**
- App was calling: `http://192.168.29.43:3000/api/sessions/create`
- But baseURL was: `http://192.168.29.43:3000/api`
- So actual call was: `http://192.168.29.43:3000/api/api/sessions/create` ❌

**The Fix:**
- Changed baseURL to: `http://192.168.29.43:3000`
- Now calls: `http://192.168.29.43:3000/api/sessions/create` ✅
